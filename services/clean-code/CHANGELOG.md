## Stage 5.1 -- Policy Steward signing-key store

### Added

- `internal/policy/keys/` package: Ed25519 keypair manager with
  rotation, half-open `[valid_from, valid_until)` window,
  policy signature verification (`Verify`, `VerifyAny`), and
  active-key projection (`ListActive`).
- `internal/policy/keys/sql_store.go`: production
  PostgreSQL-backed `Store` implementation using
  `database/sql` + `lib/pq`. Maps SQLSTATE `23505` to
  `ErrDuplicateKey` and `23514` to `ErrInvalidPublicKey`.
- `internal/policy/keys/local_kms.go`: production
  `LocalSealedKMS` -- envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM) of
  Ed25519 seeds under an operator-injected master key. Handle
  prefix `local-v1:`. The master key never touches PostgreSQL.
- `internal/policy/keys/build.go`: composition-root factory
  `Build(ctx, BuildConfig) -> (*BuildResult, error)` with
  fail-closed validation (local requires master key + PG;
  in-memory rejects both).
- `internal/management/` package: `Reader.ListActiveSigningKeys`
  + HTTP handler exposing
  `GET /v1/policy/keys/list_active` as a bare JSON array.
- `internal/evaluator/gate.go`: `Gate.VerifyPolicy` and
  `Gate.VerifyAnyPolicySignature` -- both consult the signing
  cache so the 24h overlap window is enforced uniformly across
  the evaluator surface.
- `cmd/clean-coded/main.go`: composition root now wires the
  signing-key cache, registers `signing_key_cache` readiness
  check, mounts the management routes, and spawns a 5-minute
  cache-refresh ticker.
- `migrations/0005_policy_signing_keys.{up,down}.sql`:
  `clean_code.policy_signing_keys` table with public-key
  fingerprint, opaque KMS handle, half-open lifecycle, and
  append-only grants (`INSERT`+`SELECT` to steward, `SELECT`
  to every other writer role).
- Config: `KMSProvider`, `KMSMasterKeyHex` fields with
  fail-closed validation.

### Changed

- `cmd/clean-coded/main.go` import paths corrected to the
  module path `github.com/microsoft/code-intelligence/services/clean-code/...`.
  Pre-existing `forge/services/...` import paths were broken.

### Operational notes

See `docs/runbook.md` for the operator-facing surface and
`docs/rollout.md` for the per-environment bootstrap +
verification steps.

### Scope boundaries (ratified for Stage 5.1)

These were originally floated as open operator questions and
are now PINNED so Stage 5.1 ships with a closed contract.
Future workstreams own the deferred work:

- **Transport: HTTP/JSON v1, sole ratified surface.** A gRPC
  adapter is out-of-scope. If a downstream consumer ever needs
  streaming / strong-typed verbs, a `management-grpc-adapter`
  workstream would land it alongside HTTP with regression
  tests pinning both transports to the same wire shape.
- **KMS backend: `LocalSealedKMS` (AES-256-GCM envelope) is
  the only Stage 5.1 production impl.** A managed-service
  adapter (Azure Key Vault / AWS KMS / HashiCorp Vault) is
  owned by a future `policy-steward-kms-adapter` workstream
  once the deployment-target vendor is selected. The `KMS`
  interface contract is stable, so the future adapter only
  needs to land its concrete implementation -- Manager /
  Store / rotation / evaluator integration / read verb all
  continue to work unchanged.
