# `services/clean-code` runbook

Operational guide for the clean-code service. Add a new
section here as each subsystem ships against the production
composition root (`cmd/clean-coded/main.go`).

## Policy Steward signing-key cache (Stage 5.1)

### What

The clean-code service signs every published policy bundle with
an **Ed25519** keypair. The active set of signing keys lives in
the `clean_code.policy_signing_keys` Postgres table; the matching
private keys live in the operator's KMS (envelope-encrypted under
a master AES-256-GCM key the operator injects via env var). The
24h **rotation overlap window** (tech-spec Sec 8.2 row 6) is the
key reliability mechanism -- when a new key is minted, the prior
key remains accepted for `policy_publish_overlap_min_seconds`
(default 86400 = 24h) so consumers cache catch up before signature
verification breaks.

### Configuration (env vars)

| Env var                              | Meaning                                                                                            | Required when             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `CLEAN_CODE_KMS_PROVIDER`            | `"local"` (production, envelope KMS), `"in-memory"` (test-only), `""` (scaffold mode, no signing). | always                    |
| `CLEAN_CODE_KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX`      | 64 lowercase hex chars = 32-byte AES-256 master key. Required when provider = `local`.             | `KMS_PROVIDER=local`      |
| `CLEAN_CODE_PG_URL`                  | PostgreSQL connection URL. Required when provider = `local`.                                       | `KMS_PROVIDER=local`      |
| `CLEAN_CODE_POLICY_PUBLISH_OVERLAP_SECONDS` | Rotation overlap in seconds. Defaults to 86400 (24h).                                       | never (defaulted)         |

Scaffold mode (`KMS_PROVIDER=""`) leaves the signing-key cache
unwired; `/readyz` reports `signing_key_cache` as **missing**
which keeps the listener at 503 by design.

### Read verb: `policy.keys.list_active`

The active signing-key inventory is exposed at:

```
GET /v1/policy/keys/list_active
```

Response: a **bare JSON array**:

```json
[
  {
    "key_id": "f4c1...-uuid",
    "fingerprint": "<64 lowercase hex>",
    "valid_from": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "valid_until": "2026-01-02T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

Status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 200  | List emitted (may be `[]` during the brief startup window before the first key is minted). |
| 405  | Method other than `GET` / `HEAD`. |
| 503  | Signing-key cache not wired (scaffold mode) or no active key. The route is ALWAYS mounted -- scaffold mode never returns 404. This lets operators distinguish "verb exists, backing subsystem down" from "this build doesn't ship the verb". The contract is pinned by `TestRootMux_ScaffoldModeListActive503` in `cmd/clean-coded/routes_test.go`. |
| 500  | Unexpected backend error. |

### Rotation

Routine rotation is rate-limited by the overlap window: the
`Manager.Rotate` call refuses while the most recent key is still
inside its `valid_until` cooldown. Use `Manager.ForceRotate` (or
the equivalent `keys.compromise` runbook step) for the Sec 9.3
compromise response path -- that bypass is the one and only way
to mint a successor key before the overlap expires.

### Health check

The composition root registers `signing_key_cache` as a readiness
check. It probes the KMS via `Ping` and asserts at least one key
is loaded. A KMS outage or an empty cache flips `/readyz` to 503
WITHOUT crashing the process -- the rest of the service continues
running but no new policy publishes will succeed.

### Cache refresh

Every replica re-reads the `policy_signing_keys` table every
`5m` (constant `signingKeyCacheRefreshInterval` in
`cmd/clean-coded/main.go`). This is two orders of magnitude
faster than the 24h overlap window, so a sibling-replica
rotation always propagates well before the old key expires.

### Transport

The canonical transport for `policy.keys.list_active` (and every
other read verb this service grows in later stages) is
**HTTP/JSON v1**. The path prefix is `/v1/`; a future shape
change ships under `/v2/` so dashboards keep working through the
cutover.

A gRPC/proto layer is **out-of-scope for Stage 5.1**. No
`*.proto` file or gRPC server exists in this service, the
dashboard / operator-CLI clients are already HTTP-based, and
shipping a second transport speculatively would create
wire-shape drift between two surfaces that have to be kept in
sync. If a future downstream consumer requires streaming or
strong-typed verbs, a `management-grpc-adapter` workstream
would land it -- with explicit regression tests pinning both
transports to the same wire shape. Until then, HTTP/JSON v1 is
the SOLE ratified contract.

### KMS backend

Stage 5.1 ships `LocalSealedKMS` (AES-256-GCM envelope encryption
of the Ed25519 seed under an operator-injected master key) as
the production KMS implementation. The `KMS` interface contract
is stable.

A managed-service KMS adapter (Azure Key Vault / AWS KMS /
HashiCorp Vault) is **out-of-scope for Stage 5.1** and is owned
by a future `policy-steward-kms-adapter` workstream once the
deployment-target vendor is selected by the operator. That
workstream will only need to land a new `KMS` implementation
plus its config wiring; Stage 5.1's manager, store, rotation,
overlap-window, evaluator integration, and read verb continue
to work unchanged because they depend on the interface, not the
implementation.

### Test isolation (live PostgreSQL)

When `CLEAN_CODE_PG_URL` is exported, two test suites in
different packages hit the same database:

| Suite                                                  | Owns schema             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `internal/storage/migrate_test.go::TestRoundTrip_...`  | `clean_code` (canonical migration) |
| `internal/policy/keys/sql_store_test.go::TestSQLStore_...` | `clean_code_keys_test` (isolated) |

The storage round-trip `DROP SCHEMA clean_code CASCADE`s on prep,
which is why the SQLStore live tests own a distinct schema. CI
lanes that set `CLEAN_CODE_PG_URL` can run both packages in
parallel without interference.
